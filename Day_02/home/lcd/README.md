# LCD
This repository contains all of the code for interfacing with a 16x2 Character I2C LCD Display. This accompanies my YouTube tutorial here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fR5XhHYzUK0 

You can buy one of these great little I2C LCD Displays on eBay or somewhere like the Pi Hut: https://thepihut.com/search?type=product&q=lcd

I haven't been able to test it myself personally, but it looks like a cool Forex stream. If you run into any bugs with it, please feel free to reach out to bariskisir and submit a PR.

Display your Pi's IP address - useful for SSH'ing and more!

Thanks for watching!
